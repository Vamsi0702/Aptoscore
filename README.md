Aptoscore: AI-Powered On-Chain Reputation System for Aptos

Aptoscore is an AI-powered on-chain reputation system designed for the Aptos blockchain. The system fetches transaction data from an Aptos account, processes it, and uses machine learning techniques to analyze and assign reputation scores to transactions based on various parameters, such as gas used, gas price, and transaction success. This project utilizes Python for backend logic, including the integration of the requests library for API calls to the Aptos blockchain. A Random Forest Classifier is used to train and predict reputation scores, with data preprocessing done using the pandas and sklearn libraries. A Flask web server is implemented for frontend interaction, enabling users to interact with the reputation system. The integration with GitHub ensures version control and collaboration, and the system is built for easy extensibility to enhance reputation scoring models. The project demonstrates an innovative approach to integrating AI with blockchain data for reputation management in decentralized networks.
